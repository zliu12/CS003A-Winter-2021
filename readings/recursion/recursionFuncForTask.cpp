TODO: Recursion For Tasks
1.Whenever one subtask is a smaller version of the original task to be
accomplished, you can solve the original task using a recursive function.
2.A func definition may contain a call to the func being defined, in such cases,
the func is said to be recursive.
3.A successful definition of a recursive func always includes at least one case
that do NOT involve a recursive call (as well as one or more cases that do
involve at least one recursive call). */
